# PTR---Polarized-User-and-Topic-Tracking
Polarized-User-and-Topic-Tracking Algorithm

Digital traces of conversations in micro-blogging platforms and in OSNs provide information about user opinion with a high degree of resolution. These information sources can be exploited to understand and monitor collective behaviors. In this work, we focus on polarization classes, i.e., those topics that require the user to side exclusively with one position. The proposed method provides an iterative classification of users and keywords: first, polarized users are identified, then polarized keywords are discovered by monitoring the activities of previously classified users. This method thus allows to track users and topics over time.

The algorithm is written in Python. Data are stored in MongoDB.
Install it before running the code (MongoDB and Pymongo).
The algorithm uses the following default libraries:
  - sys
  - operator
  - dateutils
  - ast
  - numpy
  - time and datetime
  
  
Run the file alg.py through the shell: pyhton alg.py #arg1 #arg2 #arg3 #arg4 #arg5 #arg6 #arg7
